                 <p>Avoid drinking high alcohol, sugar filled wines at all costs! Theyâ€™re filled with chemicals and they cause nasty hangovers.</p>
                 <br />
                 <p>As we know at Dry Farm Wines, the best tasting and healthiest wines in the world are natural wines.</p>
                 <br />
                 <p>We find wines made with as little human intervention as possible and that follow a clean protocol for winemaking: low alcohol, low sulfite, no sugar, no carbs, no industrial chemicals, no heavy filtration, and no flavor manipulation.  </p>
